# Credit Card Fraud Detection:
This project implements machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset of anonymized transactions, it applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and classification models to improve fraud detection accuracy.

## Features:
Data preprocessing & handling class imbalance (SMOTE)
Time-series analysis & feature extraction
Supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
Interactive visualizations for fraud patterns

## Technologies Used
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
VScode for development

## Dataset:
The dataset is not stored in this repository due to size limitations. Please download it from:
